Plan it to eventually clean up all of the services and 
pull shared files from here.

I will be able to set it up where I would be able 
to export this file and import from each microservice,
but it will break the Dockerfiles in each
microservice.

For now, I will add files that are shared to just keep
track and implement a plan in the future.
